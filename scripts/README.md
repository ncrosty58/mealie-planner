# scripts/

Standalone CLI utilities. Run from the project root, e.g. `python -m scripts.list_plans`
or `python scripts/list_plans.py`. They reuse `mealie_planner` clients and read `.env`.

> ⚠️ **Do not move or rename `clear_mealie.py`** — it is imported by `app.py`
> (`from scripts.clear_mealie import wipe_mealie_data`) for the dashboard "Clear" action.
